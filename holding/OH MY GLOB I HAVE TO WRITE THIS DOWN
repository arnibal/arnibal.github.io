OH MY GLOB I HAVE TO WRITE THIS DOWN

One of the entries I've planned was my thought on PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) and I was waiting for a time when I was in a contemplative mood. Well you know what? I made a list of things I wanted to write about and the PCOS topic was entitled TAE KA PCOS (YOU ARE SHIT PCOS)

I just ate some beef because it was what everyone in our family was having for dinner. I chose it over the barbecue because I figured the sugary glazing might do weird things to my self-diagnosed insulin resistance. I skipped the pancit because it had wheaty noodles, probably lots of vegetable oil I'm not so sure is coconut oil, and it had lobster balls. I just ate the grilled beef with rommaine hearts (and some probably not the healthiest Kwepie sesame dressing) and now my face is itchy and bursting with new pimples. Red. Inflamed. TMI. Gawd that CAFO beef must have been chock-full of hormones. (It was not the Kewpie dressing as I've had that before)

As much as I'd like to be a sage of stoicism, I just feel like this is the perfect time to vent about this.

I've been reading a lot of /r/PCOS and Soulcysters. Everyone's entitled to rant about this. Perhaps it's complaining but It was I've been very insecure about my body. 

While I'm at it, let me list down my fears, most of which stem from PCOS:
-my acne
-acanthosis
-possibly my small boobs (not backed by science but anecdotal speculation that you don't )
-possible infertility
-possible asexuality
-hair fall

If you don't even ovulate and you don't even have the chest to show for it and when your face is screaming "I AM FUCKING UNHEALTHY" to the world it's pretty hard to feel feminine or attractive. 

I wanted to put this up here because reading about what other "SoulCysters" were going through helped me a lot. There's this weird relief you get when you realize that you're not the only one experiencing this. Like it was a validation that I'm not insane and a freak of nature after all.

I've never had a regular period. I started logging my cycles when I figured I was in my 20's and still irregular. They averaged 42 days and when I was really stressed our the excess cortisol
