Back in 2004, I was reading through my brother's pile of Global Frequency comic books by Warren Ellis. Issue 6, entitled "The Run" featured a frequency agent who was the top "Le Parkour" practitioner in London.

Looking back on it, it was pretty neat that my first exposure to parkour was from the point of view of a traceuse saving London from bio-terrorists. A few months later my brother also made me watch B13. I only found out a decade later, 2014, who David Belle is.  
<br>

In the 10-year span where I associated parkour with fiction, Le√Øto and Sita were the only parkour practitioners I knew. In my head, traceuses were a norm. I guess that's why it surprised me when I attended my first ever parkour session that I was the only woman there (though later in the session another woman joined us!). So months later, when I heard that PKPH had a female-focused <a href="http://www.parkourphilippines.org/articles/pkphbansay-parkour-sunday-training-rules-and-regulation">bansay</a> in the works I was giddy-excited looking forward to it.  
<br>

I know female-only training sessions are a touchy subject, even in the international parkour community. Many believe segregating women during parkour training is unnecessary, even to the extent of saying it will hamper the growth of parkour. My view on this is...<i>I honestly don't see why this is such a big deal</i>. In any activity dominated by a gender, people of the minority gender will naturally form groups. Because, <i>possibly</i>, they experience the activity differently and seek people whose experiences they can relate to. Human and natural. That's why there are groups for male knitters. And no, I don't think that's hampering the growth of the knitting community. There are even more examples outside of gender differences.  
<br>

So I was happy to attended our first female-focused session for PKPH Bansay today. The women and girls, most of whom are new to parkour, had different drills and playtime split from male regulars. How was it and how did I find it different from the usual bansay?   
<br>

Some of it was as I imagined. We were new, built more similarly, and most of us had little athletic background. It felt somewhat reassuring that I wasn't the only one having a hard time with tucks. I wasn't the only one with hurt shoulders from practicing rolls.  
<br>

Some of the differences were unexpected, but quite pleasant. When I was having difficulty with a drill, I felt less frustrated about it. I found it easier to ask for help, even repeating a precision to ask someone what went wrong. I think this is because in the past whenever I was reassured by leads that they also took time to get a skill right, I never really believed it because I was the only one not getting it right! But this time around, my group shared in the struggle, so I understood better. There was also this subtle shift in mindset in doing it right vs not doing it wrong. In my group, I had been training the longest since I started attending bansay in February. Because of this, I was somehow obliged to initiate the drill for our group after the training leads finished showing and demonstrating the correct technique. From the past drills sessions, I realized I focused so much, even worried, on not doing a drill wrong. But this time I wanted to do it right because I felt like I had to show my group that it could be done. It's like a shift in motivation to get it right. You could call it big-sister syndrome.  
<br>

I really had fun this session! And I learned a lot, not just in skill but in mindset. But perhaps because it was an introductory bansay, I'd have to agree when Chela mentioned that it was milder than the usual bansay. I missed the fear that usually comes with a bansay session, and the elation that comes after conquering it. Maybe because I already conquered some of the little fears that my new sisters in parkour had just conquered today. At the end of the day, I feel I can learn a lot from both types of sessions. Training with other practitioners, regardless of gender, but of other skill levels also challenges you and exposes you to the possibilities of parkour. So also I hope to see my fellow traceuses in the regular bansay sessions.  

<br>

Prior to today's bansay, I recently joined <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/girlsacross/">Parkour Girls Across</a>, and one of the questions raised was how to get more women to practice parkour. It seems that all over the world, traceuses are also finding it hard to get other women into parkour. What I've noticed from these past five weeks of training, is that I've often been asked by fellow traceuses whether I'd be at the next bansay. I think a lot of women decided to join today's International Women's Day bansay because of the reassurance there would be other women whom they could share the experience with and relate to. I'm the same. I became friends with others new to parkour faster. I felt more compelled to try parkour again because I saw other women doing parkour. I'm grateful for the PKPH community as a whole, but I have a special heartfelt thanks reserved for Chela, Joles, Lady and Sacha for showing up consistently to bansay and appearing on the PKPH Facebook page. While I can dream of being a badass like Sita Patel, these women are my real life inspiration. But what's a girl like me to do? How can I help get more female representation in parkour?

I'll pay the favor forward. I'll show up.
