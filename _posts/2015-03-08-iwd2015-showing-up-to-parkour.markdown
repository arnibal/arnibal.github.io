Back in 2004, I was reading through my brother's pile of Global Frequency comic books by Warren Ellis. Issue 6, "The Run", featured frequency agent 992 -- a <i>Le Parkour</i> expert residing in London.

Looking back on it, it was pretty neat that my first exposure to parkour was from the POV of a traceuse saving London from bio-terrorists. A few months later my brother also made me watch B13. I only found out a decade later, 2014, who David Belle is.  
<br>

In the 10-year span where I associated parkour with fiction, Le√Øto and Sita were the only parkour practitioners I could recall. In my head, traceuses were a norm. I guess that's why it surprised me when I attended my first ever parkour session that I was the only woman there (though later in the session another woman joined us!). So months later, when I heard that PKPH had a female-focused <a href="http://www.parkourphilippines.org/articles/pkphbansay-parkour-sunday-training-rules-and-regulation">bansay</a> in the works I was giddy-excited looking forward to it.  
<br>

I know female-only training sessions are a touchy subject, even in the international parkour community. Many believe segregating women during parkour training is unnecessary, even to the extent of saying it will hamper the growth of parkour. My view on this is...<i>I honestly don't see why this is such a big deal</i>. In any activity dominated by a gender, people of the minority gender will naturally form groups. Because, <i>possibly</i>, they experience the activity differently in some ways and seek people whose experiences they can relate to. Human and natural. That's why there are groups for male knitters. And no, I don't think that's hampering the growth of the knitting community. There are even more examples outside of gender differences.  
<br>

So I was happy to attended our first female-focused session for PKPH Bansay today. The women and girls, most of whom are new to parkour, had different drills and playtime split from the male regulars. How was it and how did I find it different from the usual bansay?  
<br>

Some of it was as I imagined. We were new, built more similarly, and most of us had little athletic background. It felt somewhat reassuring that I wasn't the only one having a hard time with tucks. I wasn't the only one with hurt shoulders from practicing rolls. It was refreshing to look around and see facial expressions mirroring mine.  
<br>

Some of the differences led to realizations on how I view or react during training.  
<br>

When I was having difficulty with a drill, I felt less frustrated about it. I found it easier to ask for help, even repeating precisions to ask someone what went wrong. In the past whenever I was reassured by leads that they also took time to get a skill right, there was still a lot of self-doubt because I was the only one not getting it right! But this time around, my group shared in the struggle, so I understood better.  
<br>

I also realized that when I have questions or want to learn something I usually only approach the community members who have lead the bansay. Since the experienced women in the community were training leads for this session, I found myself approaching them more to ask about my form or technique. I'm usually in the beginner's group during regular sessions, training separately from intermediate traceuses, so this was a really welcome change.  
<br>


There was also this subtle shift in mindset in doing it right vs not doing it wrong. From the past drills sessions, I realized I focused so much, even worried, on not doing a drill wrong. Because I had been attending bansay the longest in my group (since February), I was somehow obliged to initiate with the drills after the training leads finished explaining and demonstrating the correct technique. I felt like it was on me to show my group that it could be done. It's like a shift in motivation to get it right. You could call it big-sister syndrome.    
<br>


It was different but a really fun session! And I learned a lot, not just in skill but in the way I view training. But perhaps because it was an introductory bansay, I'd have to agree when Chela mentioned that it was milder than the usual training session. I missed the fear that usually comes with bansay, and the elation that comes after conquering it. Maybe because I've already gotten over some of the little fears that my new sisters in parkour had just conquered today. At the end of the day, I feel I can learn a lot from both types of sessions. Training with other practitioners, regardless of gender, but of other skill levels also challenges you and exposes you to the possibilities of parkour. So also I hope to see my fellow traceuses in the regular bansay sessions.  

<br>

<br>

Prior to today's bansay, I recently joined <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/girlsacross/">Parkour Girls Across</a>, and one of the questions raised there was how to get more women to practice parkour. It seems that all over the world, traceuses are also finding it hard to get other women into parkour. What I've noticed from these past six weeks of training is that I've often been asked by fellow beginner traceuses whether I'd be at the next bansay. I think a lot of women decided to join today's International Women's Day bansay because of the reassurance there would be other women whom they could share the experience with and relate to.** I'm the same. I became friends with others new to parkour faster. I felt more compelled to try parkour again because I saw other women doing parkour. I'm grateful for the PKPH community as a whole, but I have a special heartfelt thanks reserved for Chela, Joles, Lady and Sacha for showing up consistently to bansay and appearing on the PKPH Facebook page. While I can dream of being a badass like Sita Patel, these women are my real life inspiration. That said, what's a beginner traceuse to do? How can I help get more female representation in parkour?  I can pay the favor forward. I'll show up.

** Oh yeah! Global Frequency is getting another shot at a <a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=57295">tv series</a>. :)

*** Just saw this <a href="http://blog.myfitnesspal.com/the-surprisingly-simple-enjoyable-way-to-make-weight-loss-stick/">article</a> describing a bit of Social Cognitive Theory. Maybe what I'm trying to describe is related to the Vicarious Experience model on trying new things.
