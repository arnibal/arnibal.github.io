I love you. I love you Sarah. I am never angry at you. But I know how you're very diappointed in me. Every time I talk to you I know there is judgement. I never know if I'm going to fall apart at the seams and have to spend the day patching me up.

No one knows. And perhaps you're struggling yourself. I'm sorry I'm not a good ditse yet. I am working on it. But lately the water has been chest high. And I;m trying to keep it cool and plod along and keep a straight back. 

I wish I were stronger. 

I'm sorry. I'm osrry parents, sorry siblings.
