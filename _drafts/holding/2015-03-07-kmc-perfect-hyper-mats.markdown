<i>I'm still learning how to use Jekyll. I need to get the hang of posting pictures so this is a picture post. Sorry for the blurry pictures. </i>

A few weeks ago I found myself volunteering to do a tedious task. De-sleeving 185 cards. Then sleeving 191 cards. Twice.

My brother came home with Haggatha the Heffer's Crushazorian Godstorm and several packs of KMC Hyper Mat Clear and KMC Perfect Size sleeves.  

...I'm really just the type to get excited over really nice card sleeves. TvT

Look at how the Perfect Size sleeves are supposed to work! What the hell KMC. That's like the HG of sleeves. So stupid and delightful at the same time. Perhaps that's why I relate to these sleeves so much. 

<br>

So I removed the old card sleeves. These are just freebie sleeves that came with the game.

Here's a comparison shot of the Hyper Mat Clear, the Perfect Size and the old sleeves. You can tell Perfect Size is much smaller.

It was pretty hard at first to slide cards into the Perfect Sizes. I discovered holding them like this and pushing with your pointy fingers was pretty effective.

Turned upside down and into the Hyper Mats.

<br>

![So cutie clear la](/assets/images/20150307-FrontSleeved.jpg)

Cutie clear at the front.

<br>

Matte at the back. So nice! Opaques would also have been cool, but even the back of the cards are pretty epic (oh pun!) in this game so the Hyper Mat Clears are perfect. 

<br>

![All done!](/assets/images/20150307-AllSleeved.jpg)

Done with the rest of 190 cards! Had to press on them gently because air was trapped inside each double sleeved card. Mt. Skullzfyre at the back! ;)

<br>

![Yes! They Fit. ](/assets/images/20150307-Cards.jpg)

Glad they still fit in the box even with the extra padding. My brother accidentally sat on the box hence the torn cover. How wizardly.  

<br>

Ah, I love KMCs. I found the tediousness pretty nostalgic. It's awesome they're now readily available here. I only have the Super Orange sleeves from back in fifth grade, and we even had to go to that shady Tsuen Wan mall to get them. They now sit in the dark hugging my old Pokemon cards. Ah memories.   

<br>

Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards: Duel at Mt. Skullzfyre is probably the most played table top game in our household so I'm super glad the cards are now doubly sleeved. I heard this game didn't get great reviews initially, so I might as well leave a short review. If you're looking for a game with strategy, calculation, thinking 5 steps ahead.. then don't play Epic Spell Wars. This game is not for tryhards. Sure you can do those things but this game is just too epic (oh here I go again sorry) those tactics randomly explode in your face. You still need to think about your spells though, so it's not entirely a mindless game. The game design, the random elements, flavor text, and the art direction really make you feel like you're in a wizard battle. It reminds us of the Wizard Battle episode in Adventure Time season 3, only more action packed. Only wizards allowed!  

<br>

It's best played, in my opinion, with four wizards. Above that, you get pretty restless waiting for the battle to end if you were killed off early in the game. Kuya sent us a heads up that <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173200/epic-spell-wars-battle-wizards-rumble-castle-tenta">Epic Spell Wars II: Rumble at Castle Tentakill</a>, is in the works though, hopefully they improved that side of the game.
