  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I was diagnosed with PCOS and prescribed birth control pills to manage my symptoms when I was 23. PCOS isn’t really a life threatening condition, but it’s a metabolic syndrome with symptoms that are SUPER ANNOYING. Later, I found out that pills (I was on Yaz) were just masking my symptoms and not really managing the cause of my PCOS. I did not feel like myself when I was on them and did not see myself gulping them down everyday in the future. What if I have to stop taking them when I’m older because of the link to cardiovascular risk? I didn’t think I was doing myself a favor by being dependent on medication. So I weaned myself off slowly last year (took me 3 months) and at 26, I’m pill-free again. </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Now the slightly harder part. Since I’m now off the synthetic estrogen and progesterone, I have to deal with whatever crap they masked for the past two and a half years. Just about two months of being off, I already have the acne and hair loss returning. Back with all the other symptoms that never went away while on medication, like my skin tag, acanthosis nigricans, and the so-called PCOS belly. There’s no one treatment for PCOS because each woman has a unique body – each one’s lifestyle and genetics are only some of the factors that play out in our body’s intricate chemical signaling. I don’t think BCPs are one-size fits all. The only way I can deal is to figure out the particular healthy lifestyle that my body wants me to live. With diet, I already improved some of the symptoms, like the lethargy and constant brain fog. :)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>So far here are some changes  I’ve been playing with:</p>

<p><br />
<u>Diet</u>:<br />
 -switched to generally low GI diet<br />
 -switched white or highly refined carbs to lower glycemic load alternatives (black rice instead of white rice)<br />
 -No more sugar in my coffee<br />
 -Limiting coffee to once per day<br />
 -Avoiding inflammatory food that might disrupt my already disrupted hormones like dairy<br />
 -Became suspicious of things that list vegetable oils in the ingredients<br />
 -Feel weird about eating out because they probably cook everything in cheap veggie oil<br />
 -Experimenting with resistant starch (potato starch)<br />
 -Cut out soda since January and have stopped craving them finally. If I feel like having a flavored drink, I drink green tea<br />
 -When craving sugar started choosing the lesser evil (eating a banana instead of that Conti’s leche flan D:)<br />
 -Only drink wine and beer if it’s free<br />
 -Learned to cook and take healthier meals to school</p>

<p><u>Exercise</u>:<br />
 -Try to get 3 hours resistance work per week   </p>

<p><u>Sleep</u>:<br />
 -Try to get 7.5 hours per day<br />
 -Trying not to nap so I don’t sleep late  </p>

<p><u>Everyday things</u>: <br />
 -Try to minimize exposure to xenoestrogens<br />
 -Become paranoid and wary about plastic cooking utensils<br />
 -Switched to a more natural laundry powder (the smell of normal laundry soap now nauseates me. I can’t borrow anything from my siblings who still use them)<br />
 -Switched to stainless steel baunan and bottle  </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I’ve gotten rid of the constant brain fog when I cut out sugar, and gained more clarity when I tried the potato starch. See, I can even write things like these now! I’m still experimenting with what I can eat. I pay closer attention to how I feel after eating certain foods and try to eliminate things my face reacts to. I guess that’s a good thing about my acne, it has turned into some weird-food-reaction indicator. I ate some beef the other day and it did not like it. Blared up all red and itchy. Thanks face. I guess you were warning me it was some CAFO meat chock-full of hormones that I should never eat again. Seriously considering if I can go pescetarian now, since I can’t afford organic beef or pork while on a student budget. (I’ve been allergic to chicken since childhood.)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Another general suggestion for PCOS is exercise. I’ve read that strength or resistance training is probably best. I haven’t had my levels tested recently but I suspect I’m estrogen dominant. A lot of estrogen is stored in fat cells. Maybe if I gain muscle mass and reduce the ratio even a tiny bit, that could help? I have never really worked out except in conditioning for PE and other recreational activities I joined with friends so I am clueless about strength training. I don’t really see myself exercising just for the sake of exercise, so I picked an activity last year that I could improve at by myself easily which happened to be parkour. I’m not sure if it’s just the exercise-induced endorphins, but I’m super happy I joined PKPH. Being exposed to strong people regularly makes you want to do more negative push-ups and box jumps. I’m still struggling with meeting the three-hour weekly quota but I feel pretty happy with this area, having been a former couch potato.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It might be TMI past this point. I’ve read a lot of horror stories on the forums where BCP ruined women’s menstrual cycles, some, even for years. After weaning, I was slightly worried because my period came back after a whopping 93 days. It’s recommended that women shed their uterine lining every three months to prevent risk of endometriosis or other complications. If my period comes that late again, I might have to get synthetic progesterone prescribed just to induce the shedding, when I didn’t want to depend on medication in the first place. </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But after a whole month of exercise and a better diet, my cycle returned to 42 days, which was close to the average before I was diagnosed. The flow is not as light as it was while I was on BCP, but it’s not painful. So I’m pretty excited about continuing with this. I’m still monitoring symptoms though, and if I feel like I haven’t made enough improvement by June, I plan to see a reproductive endocrinologist to get some specifics on where to go from here. </p>
