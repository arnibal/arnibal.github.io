    <p><i>I was supposed to write here weekly. But I noticed I’ve been writing too much about parkour. Here’s a reflection paper I wrote about orientalism in Philippine architecture instead. I like starting reflection papers because it’s initially rambling, but having to organize my thoughts eventually into understandable text is hard work for me. I got good feedback on this one though so I guess it’s worth posting. </i></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>After the debate in class, of which my role was a neutral spectator, one of the key take-aways was that the orientalism depends a lot on which viewpoint we are coming from. Our contemporary architecture was presented as mimicking or holding importance to western styles of architecture, while the opposing argument was that this is a mere inevitable product of globalization. My general opinion on this is that while these are both valid, the majority of Philippine society still holds the orientalist view. </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I also hold the opinion that this view is still held today out of ignorance. There are three modes I observed, from experience and from points in the debate, in which the orientalist view persists today: </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>1.) The purism viewpoint, where we exclude and deem all foreign influence as un-Filipino
2.) The thoughtless and unfeeling use of Filipino symbols or motifs just for the sake of labeling something Filipino
3.) The standard “western is better” viewpoint</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The purism viewpoint is the tendency to categorize Filipino architecture as Filipino only if it is reminiscent of pre-colonial architecture or veers away from foreign influence. The example presented in class was how a typical Filipino household will buy a banga or bulul to add Filipino accents to their home because these are indigenous. This is also related to the point raised in the first argument stating how Filipino architecture is always being reduced to the bahay kubo. There is also this strong reaction against architecture influenced by foreign cultures. When I read how there was unauthorized construction in Manila at the cultural heritage building, the El Hogar, I remember reading the author explaining the importance of the building in our culture because of its history. At the time, I found myself thinking, well that’s a given! The thing is that many people still view these types of buildings as unwanted products of our colonization.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This view is orientalist because this is still a form of “othering”. When we “purify” by separating what is not pre-colonial, we are defining ourselves relative to a foreign influence. This is similar to how our national language went through a purist phase where they had to invent words that did not catch on in everyday use because you cannot force culture – it’s dynamic and a random collective effort of society. This mentality is damaging because it hinders our art and architecture from catching up to our real culture, our present one, which has adapted and evolved in real time to events and circumstances we have experienced. We can still appreciate the indigenous and original, but to get past this viewpoint, we have to celebrate and create new Filipino architecture. By being innovative and exposing our society to new and good architecture, the benefits of new styles will slowly be accepted.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The second viewpoint is similar to the first one. The difference is that unlike the first viewpoint focused on authenticity and purity in the classification of things that are Filipino, this one makes a point to make everything Filipino, even when there is no need to do so (because, you know, things can just inherently be Filipino). This was touched on during the debate in how symbols or motifs that are indigenous or rural to us are blatantly slapped on to anything to instantly make it Filipino. This is what was argued in class as reducing our culture to the baro’t saya. An everyday example of this is along Boni Serrano Avenue, when you look at their railings, they’re the standard street divider but in the middle of the grille-work is a man with a salakot and other Filipino motifs. I also agree that our pavilions in the past (again, the salakot, and even those tiki motifs) were guilty of this, being too literal and unsubtle in trying to communicate our culture.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I appreciate these examples though, because they are attempts. And as Noel said in class, if we identify with the baro’t saya, then that’s us as a culture.Maybe being tacky with salakot motifs is part of our culture. But again I still find this orientalist because it limits what Filipino culture is. It identifies things as not Filipino then haphazardly slaps on a salakot or two to make it so. It comes off as insecure. Which is understandable because we really are still insecure about our culture. The remedy to this is to study ourselves, and identify what really makes us Filipino, past the rattan, bamboo, and baro’t saya. Let’s look at and immerse ourselves in the intangible aspects of our culture. Then we should simply stop trying so hard to make Filipino architecture, and like the Philippine artist movement, simply create the best architecture we are capable of, because our values and aspirations as a culture will inevitably show through these.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Then there’s the prevalent colonial-mentality viewpoint where we feel that modern, mostly western, is better. This is a tricky one because even I become guilty of this without meaning to. As mentioned in class, it’s difficult to get out of brainwashing. I’ve seen this even in my UP educated friends who I consider nationalistic and discerning. While we were walking around Teacher’s Village helping a friend look for lodging, they would point out modern-looking houses to me (their architecture student friend), telling me how they would like a house like that or how beautiful the building was. If I hadn’t studied this for 1.5 years already I would have probably agreed. Instead I would always reply how yes, it looked cool, but I would point to another house saying I liked this roof better, or how that one had more operable windows. It’s very real how we take in a lot of influences because of their aesthetics (in Micah’s words, “pinapatong lang”) even when they are not of practical use to us.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I also agree with the rebuttal and argument that the modern look of our architecture is just a natural effect of globalization. New information and technology is a boon to us. If we are to make resilient homes for our typhoon ridden climate for example, foreign information is welcome. But the key here is to be more discerning and not take everything at face value. Filipino architects must never solely depend on outside information but also make our own research, come up with styles, that are relevant to our society. When we take outside influence, we have to look at how these are useful to us as Filipinos.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In ending the debate, Ronn pointed out how much the discussion revealed how this was more of a problem of awareness. This is true because most of how I think orientalistm can be removed from our architecture involves education or a change of mindset. We were asked what we can do to take part in solving the problem in terms of spreading awareness. I think one of the ways with a low barrier to entry we can do as a generation is by spreading awareness through social media. If it’s so easy to snap a shot and say something about a couple doing PDA behind you, so is posting a 140-character critique of this ugly building you just walked by. This is a small step we can take into becoming here-ists and shifting our viewpoint back to the Philippine perspective.</p>
