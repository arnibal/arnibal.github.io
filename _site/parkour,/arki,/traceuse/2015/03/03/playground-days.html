    <p>It just sunk in how conditioning is such a big chunk of parkour. It has also sunk in how much I’ve been in avoidance of it. Back in January, I found a beginner routine which I had planned on doing twice a week. I thought buying equipment this early on would be overkill, so I designated two playground days to do the routine per week. </p>

<p>I hated the playground days. I felt extremely exposed whenever I do them. So along the way I fell off and did some other bullshit conditioning at home. Over the weekend, I somehow convinced myself that going out alone to train in a public space is a necessary part of parkour. </p>

<p>So I tried again today. I started with inclined push-ups near the see-saws and rows near the monkey bars. An old man came over to use the monkey bars for exercise but he was far enough from my space that I could still proceed with my reps. I was going through my last set when another old man came over to talk to his friend at the monkey bars.</p>

<p>     <i>“Oh, ang galing naman ng kasama mo, nag e-exercise.”</i></p>

<p>The comments were obviously directed at me. What was so great about this? They were all doing some sort of exercise themselves. It was annoying but I just wanted to finish my reps. At the fifth rep, my arms needed a break so I plopped down on the sand.</p>

<p>     <i>“O, masakit yun ah.”</i></p>

<p>It was not. :/   </p>

<p>Finishet my set, stood up to write my numbers in my notebook, which had a brown leather cover.</p>

<p>     <i>“Ano binabasa niya, bibliya?”</i></p>

<p>Ugh. Fortunately that was the last set of rows I needed. I tried to be stoic about it, just ignored everything, and walked away to a bench to do lunges. I wonder if I should have been more sociable, but I’ve spent too much time on Tumblr and felt like I wouldn’t have received side comments if I were a guy. From afar I saw people letting their dogs poop in the playground sandbox.</p>

<p>Finished a second set of foot-assisted pull ups. My arms were getting sore. Looked around to check for a place to do dips. The woman who was jogging I exchanged smiles with had left. To my right, the couple with their poopy puppy remained. Far to my left was the group of old men, bantering. The sun had risen and it was getting hot. Behind me, a man was sitting at the playground wall wearing a jacket and a beanie. I didn’t feel like doing dips anymore. I wrote in my notebook and left.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>They say parkour is also about reclaiming urban space. I recall a past lecture on how architecture isn’t limited to the built environment. Place-making involves a person’s feelings and memories tied to a space. Frankly, my feelings about the playground suck right now. There’s also the cultural aspect of being raised as a woman in the Philippines, being told not to go out alone, magpasama ka, etc. There’s this constant nagging at the back of my head that I shouldn’t be somewhere which changes the way I view a space. But I also recall Paulo Alcazaren’s words last week, on how graveyards and golf courses have become the majority of open spaces in Metro Manila. Small islands of open space like this playground need to be protected from public nuisance. Perhaps as a traceuse, I need to show up in this space in order to claim it. :/</p>

<p>I’m going to report unpeople having their dogs use the playground as a litter box. But I feel mildly defeated. Should I have said something to the couple? Or politely explained what I was doing to an annoying old man? Should I bring plastic bags and our extra pooper scooper next time and lend it to people? What would Epictetus have done? Is this the social side of being strong to be useful?</p>

<p>Game is hard.  </p>

<p><br />    <br />    <br /> </p>

<p>EDIT 03/10/2015:  <br />
Well today was playground day. Game is NOT hard. Gawd I want to delete this post. Let this serve as an example of what happens when I miss my weekend stoic meditation. What would Epictetus have done? He would have side-eyed me. </p>
