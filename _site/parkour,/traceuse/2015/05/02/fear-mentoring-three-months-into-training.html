    <p>It’s been 3 months since I first started training parkour! :) </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Lately I’ve also been training with Parkour UP. For a while, at first,  I was back to training in an environment where I was the only traceuse. But this time around I could manage to keep up with QM’s, precisions and rolls. Vaults still kill me, but Lucas and Habi are theses experts at convincing me to at least try. Thanks to their efforts I can now attempt and safely bail side vaults on 120cm-high rails on my own, which I was terrified of doing a few weeks ago. I also tried dash, speed, and reverse vault progressions which I would have never thought to attempt. I even tried to talk my way out of trying. Repeatedly! Which is why I’m really grateful to those two for matching my stubbornness. It’s a different motivational environment, training with men. I really had to focus to keep up and try my best to not be babied or slow down the drills. </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But I’m writing today because at yesterday’s training one of the beginner traceurs approached me for help on his rolls. Talk about empathizing as this guy felt like he was the only one not able to do rolls, and was starting to question why he was even doing parkour–my exact feelings during my first attempt at parkour in the same amphitheater! Surprise, men have these feelings too.  I tried my best, and at least I got him to start rolling. Lucas took over after a few attempts, which was good because he is an awesome teacher. We also had two beginner traceuses during training and I could again see myself in the same position a few months ago. Or even a week ago.  It’s mind blowing to see someone else go through that same fear and hesitation to do a side vault, or an unfamiliar precision. Or not knowing what to do while everyone else is playing around. </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Thinking about it, if I had a parkour learning theme for April I would say it’s about fear in the practice. It was this month that I became aware of how much I told myself I can’t do something until someone convinced me to try. I also remembered my resulting surprise at being able to do it. It’s just ridiculous, when I recall it, but I know I’ll have the same fears again in the future. From now on, I’ll just try to keep in mind to give Jem, Habi or Lucas a break from me ranting about the reasons I can’t. Seeing people go through the same hesitation, and knowing from my own experience that they could probably do it once they get past the hesitation reinforced this lesson further. Also, it’s one thing to read about it, but yesterday’s training with new traceuses hit home how women are culturally more open to admitting fear. And I think that’s ok, because then you know what to work on or what advice to give that might ease into lessening that fear. I also trained with Jerome for a bit, and learned that even experienced traceurs still work on their fears, but they know a lot more about the strategies or progressing into building confidence. For example, doing a precision with a 10 foot drop gives you a lot of brain fuck, so you can do it first with only one foot aligned to the gap. And finally, learning a bit more about skill, strength and their overlord the central nervous system also hammered home how much of parkour is brain training. </p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I guess I found myself in some mentor situations yesterday which was pretty dang different from the usual parkour training which is why I’m writing about it. I tried to recall and relay all the tips that mentors gave me in the past three months that worked for me. Like how you can try to jump on level ground to gauge your ability to do a precision on a higher level you are hesitant to do. Or how I was told to avoid a “Charmee” (or what I like to call a 10-20, in which you raise your feet instead of knees or hips while jumping). Or how you can grab the rails first and do some tucks to prime up to a side vault. Or how when you can’t think of anything to do, during free time or play time,  just pick something you are already did, but are still hesitant to do and keep repeating it until most of the fear is gone (this one is my original advice, since I like to do this!). Because you know, people can laugh it off how someone is stalling a 2-foot precision only 54 cm high, and tell someone to just jump. Even that same person can laugh at themselves. I’ve been in through the same situation, and it felt silly to me as well, but I also know that the fear is very real. And because I recognized that fear it felt really good to know what to say or what to tell someone to try to make then decide on their own to make the jump. It feels super good! And now I know why my parkour mentors put up with me. </p>
